# Who Cares About Climate Change? (2010-2017)
To better understand Americansâ€™ views on climate change, the [Yale Program on Climate Change Communication (YPCCC)] (http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/) and the [George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication (Mason 4C)](http://www.climatechangecommunication.org/) have conducted nationally representative surveys of U.S. adults twice a year for the past decade. 

## The Data
Surveys were administered twice a year in 'waves' from 2010-2017 (appproximately 2-3k a year). They were also administered in 2008, but not in 2009, 
so to avoid making assumptions about a gap in the data, I just cut that year out. That leaves us with:

**52 columns, 17,860 points:**
    - 3 metadata columns
    - 2 weighting columns
    - 18 opinion questions, bucketed
    - 29 demographical questions, bucketed
